This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This repository supports a graduate seminar examining video games as sophisticated philosophical texts. The course explores fundamental questions about technology, consciousness, identity, and environmental ethics through the lens of video game analysis.

## Repository Structure

This is a newly initialized repository. The content structure is yet to be established, but likely will include:
- Course materials (syllabi, schedules, assignments)
- Reading lists and philosophical texts
- Game analysis documents
- Student resources and guidelines
- Possibly code examples or interactive demonstrations related to game mechanics and philosophical concepts

## Content Guidelines

When working with this repository, keep in mind:
- This is an academic/educational context focused on philosophical analysis
- Content should maintain scholarly rigor appropriate for graduate-level study
- Any materials added should relate to the intersection of video games and philosophy, particularly around themes of technology, consciousness, identity, and environmental ethics
